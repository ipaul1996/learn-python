A virtual environment in Python is like a special, isolated folder on your computer 
where you can install Python, any libraries and packages you need—without affecting other projects 
or the main Python(Global) installation.

Create --> python3 -m venv venv
python3: calls python3 interpreter; -m venv: run the built-in venv module;
venv: name of the folder where your new virtual environment will be created. 
You can name it anything, but venv is a common convention.

Activate --> source venv/bin/activate
When you “activate” it, any Python or pip commands you run will use this folder 
instead of the system-wide Python.

Deactivate --> You can turn off the virtual environment with "deactivate" command.
