# The execution of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the

# references first look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables 
# of enclosing functions, then in the global symbol table, and finally in the table 
# of built-in names. Thus, global variables and variables of enclosing functions cannot be 
# directly assigned a value within a function (unless, for global variables, 
# named in a global statement, or, for variables of enclosing functions, 
# named in a nonlocal statement), although they may be referenced.
