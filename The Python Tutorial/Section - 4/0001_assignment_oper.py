# Assignment Operators

a = 2

# Add and assign
a += 3   # Equivalent to: a = a + 3

# Subtract and assign
a -= 5   # Equivalent to: a = a - 5

# Multiply and assign
a *= 5   # Equivalent to: a = a * 5

# Divide and assign (result is always float)
a /= 2   # Equivalent to: a = a / 2

# Floor divide and assign (result is integer division)
a //= 2  # Equivalent to: a = a // 2

# Modulus and assign (assigns remainder)
a %= 3   # Equivalent to: a = a % 3

# Exponentiate and assign (raise to the power)
a **= 2  # Equivalent to: a = a ** 2
