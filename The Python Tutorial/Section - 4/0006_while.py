# 'while'
# The 'while' statement repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition is true.
# The while loop is useful when you don't know in advance how many times you need to repeat the block.

# Basic syntax:
# while condition:
#     # code block to repeat

# Example: Counting from 0 to 4
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Count is:", count)
    count += 1  # Increment count
