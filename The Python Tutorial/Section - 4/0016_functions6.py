# Here, / and * are optional. If used, these symbols indicate the kind of parameter by
# how the arguments may be passed to the function: positional-only, positional-or-keyword,
# and keyword-only. Keyword parameters are also referred to as named parameters.
# If / and * are not present in the function definition, arguments may be passed
# to a function by position or by keyword.
# Positional-only parameters are placed before a / (forward-slash). The / is used to
# logically separate the positional-only parameters from the rest of the parameters.
# If there is no / in the function definition, there are no positional-only parameters.
# Parameters following the / may be positional-or-keyword or keyword-only.
# To mark parameters as keyword-only, we place an * in the arguments list just before
# the first keyword-only parameter.

# ******************************************************
# This function demonstrates a potential collision between a positional argument 'name'
# and a keyword argument 'name' passed via **kwds. If 'name' is passed as a keyword,
# it will override the positional argument, which can lead to confusion.
def foo(name, **kwds):
    # Checks if 'name' is present in the keyword arguments
    return "name" in kwds


# The following call would raise a TypeError because 'name' is given both positionally and as a keyword:
# foo(1, name=2)
# foo(1, **{'name': 2})


# To avoid this ambiguity, we can make 'name' a positional-only parameter using the '/' syntax.
def fooV2(name, /, **kwds):
    # Now, 'name' must be passed positionally, and any 'name' in **kwds is a separate entry.
    return "name" in kwds


# Here, 'name' is passed as a keyword argument, so 'name' is present in kwds and returns True.
print(fooV2(1, name=2))  # Output: True

# Here, 'name' is passed via dictionary unpacking, so again 'name' is present in kwds and returns True.
print(fooV2(1, **{"name": 2}))  # Output: True
